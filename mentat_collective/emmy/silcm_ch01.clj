;; ##!!Draft Version!!

;; I investigate a Lorentz covariant Lagrangian that is not widely known. It is discussed in the textbooks of Greiner, "Systems of Particles and Hamiltonian Mechanics" (chapter 21), and also [on-line in: Cline, "Variational Principles in Classical Mechanics"](https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Classical_Mechanics/Variational_Principles_in_Classical_Mechanics_(Cline)/17%3A_Relativistic_Mechanics/17.06%3A_Lorentz-Invariant_Formulation_of_Lagrangian_Mechanics).

;; Then I derive, along deBroglie's argument, the momentum-wavelength relation of a free particle.

;; It is very interesting that a constant term can lead to a new formalism. Cline: "It provides a plausible manifestly-covariant Lagrangian for the one-body system, but serious problems exist extending this to the N-body system when N>1".

;; Nobody possesses a Lorentz covariant N-body mechanics. Goldstein "Classical Mechanics", chapter 7.9: "Hitherto, there does not exist a satisfying description of the relativistic many body system."

;; ### The Constraint on the four dimensional path

;; The Lagranian above looks very nice because it is symmtreic in t, x, y, z. But there is a caveat which ultimately brings it in line with the orthodox formulation.

;; Non-homogeneous but symmetric Lagrangians of this type require a general implicit constraint: $L - pv = 0$ (Cline Eq. 17.6.12, Struckmeier Eq. 21.9)

;; The above is a constraint, i.e. needs to be zero, needs to vanish for all physical paths.

;; For the free particle, we should think of it as a constraint on p, a constraint known as the mass shell or on-shell condition, usually written (thereby omitting the c) as $-p^2 = m^2$. This on-shell constraint is the correct version of the popular $E = mc^2$. Let's show that the above constraint indeed is the same as $-p^2 = m^2c^2$:

(define p
  ((Lagrange-momentum (Lc-free-particle 'm_0 'c)) Lc-path))

(show-tex-expression

;; Inverse means that $t(s(y)) = y$. While in the math rendering there is a minor risk of confusion, in the underlying code we do not need the auxilary `y`, the function `t` and the symbol `'t` are clearly distinct:

;; The first two equations are the same, as $ct' = x'$ also means $ct'' = x''$.
;; The function $\sigma(s)$ remains completely arbitrary, and $s$ remains
;; a parameter. Trying to get $s$ as a function of $t$ is in vain.

;; Also the original constraint does not reveal anything new:

                  (Gamma dynamic-path)) 's)))

;;### The preferred parameter choice for massless particles
;; But something still can be done. By making $s$ a functions (not of $t$ but of)
;; some parameter $r$ and setting $\sigma(r)$ to be $\sigma(r) = ds/dr$,
;; we can simplify the first two Lagrangian equations of motion to:

^:kindly/hide-code
(show-tex-expression

         (D (D (literal-function 'x)))) 'r))

;; Let's start the proof.
;; The momentum is

(show-tex-expression
  (((Lagrange-momentum (Lc-dynamic 'm 'c)) dynamic-path) 's))

;; Take the momentum for $x$.
;; The key insight is recognizing the following:
;; Since the free Lagrangian depends on $dx/ds$ only,
;; the Lagrange equation is the derivative of this momentum. So:
;; $d/ds(\sigma · dx/ds) = 0$,
;; this means $\sigma · dx/ds = C$ (some constant).

;; Now we introduce the variable $r$ and make s a function of $r$, $s(r)$.
;; And we choose $\sigma$ to be $\sigma = ds/dr$.
;; This is a common gauge choice or parametrization condition.

;; Now: $dx/dr = dx/ds · ds/dr = dx/ds · \sigma$.
;; But we know $\sigma · dx/ds = C$, so:
;; $dx/dr = C$ (constant!). Therefore:

;; $$\frac{d²x}{dr²} = 0$$

;; To quote Zee, Gravitiy in a nutshell, p215:
;; > A parameter that makes the equation of motion take on this simple form
;; > is known as an affine parameter. We don’t have to solve any
;; > equation of motion to know that (t, x, y, z) is proportional to (1, 1, 0, 0).
;; > End of story. No need to parametrize this worldline.

;; > But if you insist, you could write X=f(s)(1,1,0,0) with some monotonic

;; > To me, the pages some texts spend on the affine parametrization
;; > of massless particles literally amounts to much ado about nothing.
