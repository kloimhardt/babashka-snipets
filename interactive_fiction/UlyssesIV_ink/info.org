Open UlyssesIV.ink with Inky application. Save it to json file.

start
python3 -m http.server
open
http://localhost:8000/

the inkJS story interpreter is from https://github.com/y-lohse/inkjs/tree/master/templates/browser_with_server

The main package is on npm
https://www.npmjs.com/package/inkjs?activeTab=code
There is also an inkjs-compiler.js
/inkjs/bin/inkjs-compiler.js
but that only works with node. https://browserify.org/ might do the trick, but I did not try.

The interpreter is for the browser on unpkg
<script src="https://unpkg.com/inkjs@2.3.2/dist/ink.js"></script>

I added a special :b feature to main.js for bold text
<img> can be added directly
